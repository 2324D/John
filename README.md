Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 It is the systematic application of engeneering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
** Importance**
Enables creation of reliable,scalable and innovative software solutions that meets user needs

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements that is gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design that is creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation that is writing and building software according to its specifications.
Testing.Conducting tests and ensuring the software meets quality standards and functionality.
Deployment.Realeasing the software to users and customers.
Maintenance.Providing updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing down example Requirements,design,implementation,testing,deployment and maintenance while Agile involves iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change example roles.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance engeneer ensures softwares quality by designing and conducting tests.
Project manager oversees the planning,execution and delivery of the software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated development environment provides comprehenssive tools for writing,debuging and testing code example visual studio.
Version control systems provides tools for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating work among member example git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements,tight deadline and technical debts these challenges can be overcome through proper communication,prioritization of tasks and using agile method.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.Unit testing involves testing individual components.
Intergration testing involves testing interaction between different components.
System testing involves testing the entire software system.
Acceptance testing involves testing the software against its user requirements.
All the above ensures the software products meets the specified quality standards and functional requirements.



Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**Vogue**Tell me about the presidents
**clear**Tell me about the president of kenya.The improved prompt is clear,concise,complete and correct.
